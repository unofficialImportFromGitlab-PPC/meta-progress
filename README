This README file contains information on the contents of the
progress layer.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.


Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
  branch: rocko

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
  layers: meta
  branch: rocko

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
  layers: meta-openembedded
  branch: rocko
  
  URI: https://github.com/meta-qt5/meta-qt5.git
  layers: meta-qt5
  branch: rocko
  
  URI: https://github.com/schnitzeltony/meta-qt5-extra.git 
  layers: mera-qt5-extra
  branch: rocko
  
  URI:  git://github.com/OSSystems/meta-browser.git
  layers: mera-browser
  branch: master
  
In additon to these, it is reocmmended to add another layer which includes hardware configurations filese to build, as an example, a kernel for a Mac Mini G4.

I. Adding the progress layer to your build
=================================================

This section explains how to add this layer to your Yocto environment. In addition to the Yocto base distributtion, to build an image the following additional layers are required:

meta-openembedded
meta-qt5
mera-qt5-extra
meta-progress
meta-progress-bsp
meta-browser

Currently the recommended way to build an image is to set meta-progress layer to its rocko branch. This means all required layers must be using rocko branch too.

git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
cd poky
git checkout rocko

git clone git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
cd meta-openembedded
git checkout rocko
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/meta-qt5/meta-qt5.git
cd meta-qt5
git checkout rocko
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/schnitzeltony/meta-qt5-extra.git 
cd meta-qt5-extra
git checkout rocko
cd ..

git clone https://gitlab.com/oshw-powerpc-notebook/meta-progress.git
cd meta-progress
git checkout rocko
cd ..

git clone https://gitlab.com/oshw-powerpc-notebook/meta-progress-bsp.git
cd meta-progress-bsp
git checkout rocko
cd ..

git clone git://github.com/OSSystems/meta-browser.git
# There is not rocko branch
# cd meta-browser
# git checkout rocko


Now we will create the buidl environment:

cd ..
source poky/oe-init-build-env

You will be entered in a directory called build. There are two important files in the conf folder; bblayers.conf and local.conf

Your bblayers.conf file should be like this:

# POKY_BBLAYERS_CONF_VERSION is increased each time build/conf/bblayers.conf
# changes incompatibly
POKY_BBLAYERS_CONF_VERSION = "2"

BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}"
BBFILES ?= ""

BBLAYERS ?= " \

  YOUR_ABSOLUTE_PATHT_TO_POKY/meta-browser \

II Cook an image
=============

In the local.conf you should change the line containing

MACHINE ??= "quemux86"

to 

MACHINE ??= "qemuppc"

or if you want to build an image for a real Mac Mini G4

MACHINE ??= "minig4"

The creation of a yocto image requires a lot of disk space. In our case it probably will consume more than 30GB so it is suggested to add this line at the end of your local.conf. 

INHERIT +=  " rm_work"

On the contrary, if you ommit this directive future builds could take less time to finish.

It's time to build our image. Currently you can make use of two recipes. First one is core-image-progress-minimal whichs is a basic graphical environments. The second is core-image-progess and includes additional applications such as a music player and a web browser. As a first expereicen we recommend to create a minimal image as every single package will be compiled from scractch and that means a lot of time.

bitbake core-image-progress-minimal

The build could take some hours, so be patient. When finished, if you created a qemuppc image, you can launch qemu as follows

runqemu qemuppc
